# Dotfiles
My environment configuration files for shell, tmux and vim.
I work in OS X so I can't guarantee this will work on other *nix derivatives.

Once upon a time I typed something to the likes of <br>
`$ echo "my-config=setting" > ~/.zshrc` <br>
instead of <br>
`$ echo "my-config=setting" >> ~/.zshrc` <br>
and overwrote my config.

Never again.


## Usage
This is a backup of my dotfiles, but you're welcome to use them. Clone the repo somewhere on your machine, copy what you want into your home directory.


## Contents

### .zshrc
Slightly modified version of .oh-my-zsh with some handy aliases for my current dev stack.

### .tmux.conf
I'm new to tmux but this is the most exciting for me at the moment. I use tmuxinator to define 'dev' and 'blog' projects I can quickly tap into pre-configured tmux sessions.

### .vimrc
I'm most proud of this, especially thanks to [Kevin](https://github.com/kmckelvin) for his help on this one.

### .gitconfig
Random git config, basically for me.

### Others
Brewfile for replicating some of the brews that I like if my machine were destroyed / stolen by a rogue beaver of sorts.
